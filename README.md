# Piano Web App 
This project is a simple web-based piano that allows users to play notes by clicking keys on a virtual keyboard. Each key triggers an API call to a Java RESTful Spring Boot server, which processes the request and plays the corresponding audio file.

# Project Overview
This application is designed to simulate a virtual piano using a web server interface. When a piano key is clicked, it sends a signal to an API built with Java Spring Boot. The API then plays an audio file corresponding to the note selected, providing a musical experience through a simple web interface.
